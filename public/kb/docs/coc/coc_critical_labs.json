Review current meds/recent changes (diuretics, insulin, ACE/ARB, potassium supplements, anticoagulants). Notify provider using SBAR with objective data.

      "body": "Treat K=2.5 mmol/L as a critical/urgent result. Evaluate for weakness/cramps, palpitations, dizziness/syncope, and hydration/GI losses (vomiting/diarrhea). Review contributing meds (diuretics, insulin, beta-agonists, laxatives) and consider concurrent low magnesium. Obtain vitals and monitor for arrhythmia symptoms; obtain EKG/telemetry if available/ordered. Notify provider promptly with SBAR; anticipate repeat labs and replacement orders per provider. Escalate to ED if symptomatic, unstable vitals, suspected arrhythmia, or unable to manage safely in facility per policy/provider direction."
